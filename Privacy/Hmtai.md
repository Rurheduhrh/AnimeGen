# Hmtai API Usage

> [!Note]
> Since version 1.6-23 on the settings app you can enable the "Developer Mode". With this you can now edit the default "Discord Bot Token", "Discord Webhook" and "Discord Channel ID", giving you full controll of your data. And so, AnimeGen does not store any of your datas!


When utilizing the Hmtai API, the generated images are seamlessly sent to a designated Discord channel. This integration addresses the issue of Discord CDN URLs displaying "This content is no longer available." It's important to note that the images generated through this process are not used for any malicious purposes.

It's worth highlighting that my system does not collect any additional data, such as device information, iOS version, model details, or regional data. The sole purpose of the integration is to enhance the user experience within Discord channels without compromising privacy.
